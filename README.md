- **`Dataset1/Codebook_Dataset1.csv`**  
  Codebook detailing the structure and coding categories used in **Dataset 1**.

- **`Dataset2/Dataset2.csv`**  
  Anonymized excerpts from interviews used for analysis in **Chapter 4: The Theory**.

- **`Dataset2/Codebook_Dataset2.csv`**

### 5. Interview Metadata
- **`Interviews_Metadata.csv`**  
  Anonymized metadata sheet containing basic information about the 23 interviews conducted, including:

### 6. Other Datasets Used
- **ENOP Calculation Files (`Other Datasets Used/1951_ENOP.csv` through `Other Datasets Used/2024_ENOP.csv`)**  
  These files contain manually compiled national-level electoral results for each general election year from **1951 to 2024**.  
  They were used to calculate the **Effective Number of Parties (ENOP)** at the national level in the absence of publicly available ready-to-use datasets (e.g., from TCPD).

- **`Other Datasets Used/potential_coalitions.csv`**  
  This file is derived from `df_state` and contains manually coded information on:
  - Presence of coalition governments at the state level
  - Names of major coalitions
  - Additional variables capturing coalition dynamics in state governments
