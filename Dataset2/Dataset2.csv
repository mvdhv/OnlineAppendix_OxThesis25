R1,"When the central and state governments are aligned—like when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is in power at both levels—the coordination is good. But where they are not aligned, things don’t work out. For instance, the central government can withhold funds or block the state budgets. If a state doesn’t follow the central government’s directions, they won’t release the funds. If they go along with what the BJP say, things might go smoothly for a while. But the biggest issue is this: if we don’t give you the budget, how will you drive development? And if you can’t deliver development, you’ll inevitably fall behind compared to other regions. And once you lag behind, we’ll (the BJP) come back during the next elections, show people dreams, and form our government again. The primary tactic is withholding the budget—without funds, development halts, and everything else falls apart. It has a huge impact—an enormous impact.

That’s who the people are voting for. When we come to the opposition group, it is largely formed by Muslims who are against him on Hindutva on the temple movement and the liberal Hindus, who think religion is something that should be practiced at home and one should mix religion into politics.

R5,"Another possibility [of democratic preservation] is that a political party emerges that claims to work solely on this issue and, if it succeeds in winning over the people, then maybe change can happen. Look, there was once a party that came to power on the promise of fighting corruption—it was called the Aam Aadmi Party. As soon as it entered politics in India, it caused an uproar. But the moment it became involved in the political system, it became just like the other parties. Even it couldn’t save itself. A long time ago, when we were young, a political party had emerged where all its members were students. The person who became Chief Minister was named Prafulla Mahanta. He was a student leader at Guwahati University at the time.

R5,"The political process in our country, from the very beginning, was divided on the basis of religion. The day before India gained independence, we were already divided on religious grounds. Then, instead of focusing on development, our primary concern became Pakistan. Even today, if I ask people in my program about the key issues that influence their vote, I find very few who are what we call ""floating voters."" In India, it is estimated that only 10% of voters fall into this category—those who decide based on what facilities they have received or not received. But 90% of voters make their decisions based on identity rather than governance. It is a simple fact. If someone is Muslim, they will not vote for Narendra Modi, they will not vote for the BJP. The reason is straightforward—because when Modi asks for votes, what does he invoke? Temples, the name of Lord Ram, the chant of ‘Jai Shri Ram.’",Media,Neutral,India,BJPStates,PartyRule,Mechanism,DecreasesDemocracy,BJP rule -> Hindutva agenda -> increased polarization -> subnational backsliding,Electoral,NA,2
R6,"See, at one point, there was a ""double-engine"" government. In 2014, the BJP was in power both at the state and central levels, so at that time, both governments worked together. But Jharkhand has always faced exploitation because of its mineral wealth. Despite the fact that the state provides a large share of the country’s minerals, the central government has not given it the royalty payments it is owed. A huge amount—around ₹1.36 lakh crore—is still pending. Similarly, under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Jharkhand needed 8 lakh more houses, and our Chief Minister repeatedly requested funds, but they were not provided. However, Uttar Pradesh received the funds. Since the current state government here is not from the ruling party at the center, there has been significant discrimination by the central government—this is an accusation that has been made multiple times. So, our Chief Minister launched a separate housing scheme at the state level. He announced that instead of waiting for funds from the central government, the state government would build homes for the poor, and not only that, but they would be three times bigger than the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana homes, with three-bedroom houses being provided. So, there is definitely some level of discrimination by the central government in resource allocation when a state government belongs to the opposition party.",Government,JMM,Jharkhand,Jharkhand;OppositionStates,PartyRule;FiscalDependence;SubnationalAutonomy;EconomicDevelopment,Causal;Mediating;Mediating;Mediating,IncreasesDemocracy,Opposition rule -> withheld central funds -> autonomy to initiate own development -> subnational stability,Economic,OutcomeStability,3
R6,"I can’t speak too much about other states, because in some places, people are very fickle-minded. If you look at Bihar, for example, what’s happening there? Everything changes so quickly. One day someone is in the BJP, the Chief Minister moves there, then the next day they ally with the RJD to form the government, and then they go back to the BJP. It feels like these changes are only for self-interest—wherever they see personal gain, they shift sides. But look at our state. Our Chief Minister is facing ED raids and all kinds of pressure, yet he is standing firm. He is saying, ""No, we will stick to our ideology. We will not bow down, we will not compromise.""

R6,"See, this is like the saying about the Delhi sweet—whether you eat it or not, you will regret it either way. It is the same with this issue. If you have a double-engine government, then small regional parties, which I previously mentioned are crucial for preserving culture, language, and identity, may struggle. But these regional parties are essential because they help ensure that local identities and cultural heritage are safeguarded. They provide representation for local issues, help communities progress, and can even rise to positions in ministries at the national level. However, the downside is that when different parties govern the center and the state, the central government often discriminates against the state government. Regardless of which party is in power, there is always an attempt to withhold resources from opposition-led state governments because the ruling party at the center fears that if the opposition-led state government is given enough support, it will gain strength, perform well, and make it harder for the central ruling party to win elections in that state. So, both systems have their advantages and disadvantages. A double-engine government can ensure smoother governance and resource allocation, but it can also weaken regional parties and local representation. On the other hand, a government where states maintain autonomy is crucial for preserving diverse cultures and identities, but it often leads to friction with the central government, which can result in discrimination in the allocation of resources.",Government,JMM,Jharkhand,OppositionStates,PartyRule;SubnationalAutonomy,Causal;Causal,IncreasesDemocracy,Desire for subnational autonomy -> rise of regional parties -> challenge the ruling party -> preservation of regional culture and aspirations -> subnational stability,Electoral,OutcomeStability,4
R6,"The state does want democracy to survive, but secular parties want it even more because secular parties work with everyone. The culture of our country was not built in a single day; it has evolved over centuries. The French, Dutch, Portuguese, Mughals, Pathans, and British all came here for trade and then settled here. Not everyone went back. Their languages, cultures, and traditions merged into ours, and over time, everything became interconnected. In some cases, even their distinct identities faded, and it became impossible to distinguish where they originally came from. That is why our Constitution grants equal status to all languages, all religions, and all castes. If democracy is threatened, then all of these groups will be at risk. If democracy is lost, they will face significant challenges. Take, for instance, Pakistan or other Muslim-majority countries—minority religions in those countries have to endure a lot. This is why democracy is essential. Our Constitution ensures that all castes, religions, and economic classes—whether rich or poor—are treated equally under the law and enjoy the same rights and opportunities. The moment democracy is threatened, minority groups will start facing hardships. If, for example, India were to become a Hindu Rashtra, minorities here would suffer in the same way that Hindus in Pakistan do.",Government,JMM,Jharkhand,OppositionStates,PartyRule,Mechanism,IncreasesDemocracy,Opposition rule -> favours democratic values -> subnational stability,Electoral,NA,2
R6,"Their role is to remain secular and to treat everyone equally. For instance, during the previous BJP government, incidents of mob lynching had increased significantly. Lynchings were happening over everything, not just between Hindus and Muslims but also between Christians and Santhals. There were cases where Christian converts among Adivasis started facing hostilities. A climate was created where Hindus and Muslims were pitted against each other, and at the same time, Christians and Adivasis were also in conflict. One has to examine what the agenda behind this was. In the previous BJP government, there were instances where those who had carried out mob lynchings were not only released from jail but were garlanded and honored by BJP leaders upon their release. When such criminals are publicly celebrated, it emboldens others to commit similar crimes because they see that these actions are not punished but rather rewarded. That is why, regardless of which caste or religion a criminal belongs to, they should not be encouraged, and they should not be shielded. This country belongs to everyone, and every caste and religion has played a role in its history and development. If you take pride in the Taj Mahal being one of the Seven Wonders of the World, then you should not harbor hatred toward the people who built it.",Government,JMM,Jharkhand,Jharkhand;BJPStates,PartyRule,Mechanism,DecreasesDemocracy,BJP rule -> Hindutva agenda -> increased polarization -> subnational backsliding,Electoral,NA,2
R6,"[So, under the JMM government, what changes took place that led to these issues being addressed?] Change does not happen overnight, but one major difference is that mob lynching has stopped. People no longer live in fear. The atmosphere is such that anyone can go anywhere freely now. This was achieved because crimes like mob lynching were not ignored. If political leaders and law enforcement turn a blind eye to such crimes, then the perpetrators become more confident, and the incidents increase. But when strict action is taken, when the police and administration are firm, and when people know that they will face severe punishment for committing such acts, they stop doing them. This is exactly what happened. If riots or disturbances break out, it is up to the administration to decide whether to protect the rioters or to punish them. If the administration protects them, then they will repeat their actions. If they punish them, then law and order are maintained. So, ultimately, it is in the hands of the state government and the political party in power to determine what kind of environment they want to create.",Government,JMM,Jharkhand,Jharkhand;OppositionStates,PartyRule,Causal,IncreasesDemocracy,Opposition rule -> favours democratic values -> subnational stability,Electoral,NA,5
R7,"Now, coming to political parties—there is the ruling party and the opposition. Naturally, if a crisis threatens democracy, it will come from the ruling side. In response, the opposition will stand against it—not necessarily out of concern for the country but because they need to protect their own existence.

R8,"Now, if we look at the trend in recent years, we can see that this has always been the case. Since independence, initially, Congress dominated everywhere—it had a hegemony, with its governments in nearly all states. But later, other governments emerged, led by political parties from different ideological camps. Communist governments came to power, first in Kerala and later in Bengal, where they remained in power for a long time. The Janata Party government was formed in Kerala at one point. Later, socialist governments, representing the ideals of social democracy, also came into power in certain states. So, Indian democracy has never had a unitary character—it has never been exclusively socialist, rightist, or communist.

R8,"However, in recent years, what has happened is that a majority of provincial governments are either directly led by the ruling party at the center or by their allied parties. Around 17 or 18 states—perhaps around 20, though I cannot say for certain—have governments that are either directly run by the BJP or formed with their support. In these states, the relationship between the center and the state remains normal. But in states where the ruling party belongs to an opposition camp, there is constant struggle between the center and the state. There is an ongoing power struggle, a continuous political battle. So, the situation is not the same across all states. Bihar has one scenario, Bengal has another, and Kerala has yet another. But ultimately, the dominant forces in India will always be those that rule at the center. Most government policies are dictated by the center, and therefore, democracy does not function in the same way everywhere; its strength and nature vary from state to state.",Civil,SFI,Delhi,Bihar;West_Bengal;Kerala;OppositionStates,PartyRule;Mobilization,Causal;Mediating,IncreasesDemocracy,Opposition rule -> democratic threats from the centre -> risk to the survival of the opposition -> mobilization of opposing forces -> subnational stability,Electoral,NA,2
R8,"It is not that all opposition-led states are perfectly democratic. If a matter is related to a rival political camp, then even opposition-led states often violate fundamental rights. Take Bengal, for instance—Bengal is governed by the opposition, by the TMC under Mamata Banerjee. Yet, even there, a cartoonist can be jailed for making a caricature of Mamata Banerjee. The police can arrest people for that. This has happened. Similarly, if you look at the center, people have been imprisoned without charges for five or six years. Whether it is a particular case in Jharkhand or the case of Father Stan Swamy, an activist who died in jail without even facing trial, these instances reflect a trend. Chargesheets are not filed, trials do not begin, and yet people remain imprisoned for years. This tendency is stronger in the current central government—it has been more aggressive in curbing democratic freedoms and fundamental rights. However, this tendency is also present in opposition-led states, especially when it involves activists or members of rival political parties. The difference between the center and these states is a matter of degree, but such instances do exist across the board, though they are fewer in number in opposition-ruled states.",Civil,SFI,Delhi,West_Bengal;Jharkhand;OppositionStates,PartyRule,Mechanism,DecreasesDemocracy,Opposition rule -> dissent -> suppression by copying the autocratizers -> subnational backsliding,NA,NA,5
R8,"If we take fundamental rights as a basis, for example, the right to practice any religion, the right to worship in one’s own way, and the right to propagate one's religion—this can be a major parameter. If we look at West Bengal, although it is often accused of Muslim minority appeasement, I consider that to be an incorrect characterization. That state still upholds these rights. The government of Kerala also upholds these rights. At the very least, I can say that the ruling party in Kerala does not discriminate based on religion. The same can be said for Tamil Nadu under the DMK government—they do not discriminate on the basis of religion. However, I cannot say the same for the government of Uttar Pradesh or the government of Assam. These are BJP-ruled states, governed by the right-wing, and their actions exhibit clear religious intolerance, particularly against minorities. This is evident in their actions. When a crime is committed, people from one religious group are arrested and punished, while those from another group are not subjected to the same action.

Then they say that everything has been since neutralized, now it is 30-32%. Because what they did was make it cesses and surcharges.

R5,"You will notice a pattern—states with lower population densities tend to have fewer such issues. Now, I cannot pinpoint the exact reason for this, but in my opinion, wherever population is controlled, these problems are less prevalent. You can call this a philosophical or psychological explanation, but I feel that if someone from an upper caste refuses to let a Dalit sit at the same level, it comes from a fear—a fear that if the Dalit is allowed to sit as an equal today, tomorrow, they will rise above, and those who once held dominance will lose their status. In highly populated states, this fear manifests more aggressively, leading to widespread discrimination. However, in states with smaller populations, you will rarely see such blatant caste conflicts. What you may see instead are class conflicts, and even those are often politically engineered. Look at what happened in Manipur. It is a beautiful state with wonderful people, and you wouldn’t even be able to tell which community someone belongs to just by looking at them. But what happened? Politicians interfered for their own political gains. They created a rift between the Meitei and the Kuki communities. And what triggered it? A High Court order that suggested granting Scheduled Tribe (ST) status to the Meitei community. Politicians took advantage of this, inciting the Kuki community by saying, ""If Meiteis get ST status, your rights will be taken away."" Eventually, the High Court even removed that paragraph from its order, but by then, the damage was done. If a class conflict arose in Manipur, it was not a natural occurrence; it was politically instigated for electoral benefits. Why? Because the Meitei community makes up about 60% of the population, while the Kuki community is around 40-45%. By fueling resentment among the Kukis, politicians ensured that the larger 55-60% vote share would consolidate in their favor. This kind of vote-bank politics is what led to the unrest, even though such things were never a part of Northeast politics before.

But if we have ₹5,00,000 and the number of people increases, then the share per person decreases. So, when there is scarcity, people want more, and they will look for ways to suppress the weakest and take away their share. This directly leads to class conflict. It is a simple aspect of human psychology—""I want more, I want what I need, no matter where it comes from.""

Many Bengali-speaking people have been part of the political landscape. I myself am Bengali. Even in my party, there are Bengalis. So, this combination of influences has shaped Jharkhand.

The very foundation of Indian culture is coexistence. Coexistence means that people can live together in harmony. This idea of coexistence is what defines Indian culture, and our culture is deeply rooted in this principle. The very essence of Indian culture is found in the village, which is why it is said that the soul of India resides in its villages. Villages represent family and neighborhood, coexistence and mutual dependence. This interconnected existence is democracy itself. We keep emphasizing the significance of the village because it is here that people live together, care for each other, and seek solutions that benefit all equally. This is the essence of democracy. It is about having the right to make decisions within one’s own domain, and when that domain expands, decision-making becomes collective. Individual leadership and collective leadership both coexist within this framework. If one were to deeply research this and conduct an extensive study, scientifically, many profound insights would emerge. My point is simply that all these elements are deeply ingrained in democracy. Now, no matter how many comforts or material possessions you provide to a person, if you take away their right to make decisions about themselves, they will eventually react against it. You might say, ""We will provide everything for you, but you must live where we tell you and sit where we decide."" But no one will ever truly accept such an arrangement. This is where a person’s sense of existence—their aham (self-identity)—awakens. ""What will remain of my identity? Where will I stand?"" When these questions arise, a deep existential awareness emerges. And this awareness is not just limited to cities; it arises at the village level, within families, within castes, within geographical regions.",Civil,Neutral,India,NA,SubnationalAutonomy;Mobilization,Causal;Mediating,IncreasesDemocracy,Different regions -> different cultures and aspirations -> democratic threats from the centre -> risk to the survival of regional cultures and aspirations -> mobilize against centre -> subnational stability,Mobilization,NA,3

There are numerous examples of this. Whenever democracy has been threatened, people have reacted, and power has changed hands. They have given leadership a chance, and when they have found it unsatisfactory, they have replaced it again. This has happened multiple times. Not long ago, a movement arose, which I wouldn't necessarily call the Aam Aadmi Party, but rather the Anna Movement. Consider how, at one point, it seemed as if every individual had become a part of corruption, that even the common person had accepted corruption as a norm. However, when the anti-corruption movement began, every town square in the country was filled with people protesting against corruption. And this was not just performative—it was a fire within them.

If a person from the minority community is seen carrying beef, it could even cost them their life. This has happened in Noida, in Jharkhand—there have been multiple cases where vehicles have been stopped, people have been beaten, even killed over allegations of cow smuggling. The cow issue is highly sensitive here. But what about Goa? The BJP has a government there, and the people consume beef. Yet, in Goa, they remain completely silent on beef. They do not utter a single word against it. The Northeast is another example. There was a minister, still in the cabinet, who previously served as the Law Minister and was also in the Ministry of Home Affairs before that—Kiren Rijiju. He has openly said, not just once but multiple times, that he eats beef. He has publicly declared, ""I eat beef, who can stop me?"" Did the BJP expel him? No. And he was not a minor figure; he was influential. When he was in the Home Ministry, he held an important position, and later he became the Law Minister. He had significant influence in constitutional matters and Supreme Court cases, and he was a well-regarded leader within the BJP. But despite his open admission of eating beef, was he removed from the party? No, he was not. Take Tripura as another example. Previously, the government there was run by the Communist Party of India (CPI-M), which remained in power for four or five consecutive terms. But now, the BJP has taken over. The top BJP leaders who went there to campaign would sit and eat beef with the local people. I can even mention a name—one of their key figures, originally from Maharashtra, was given charge of Tripura. He used to sit among the tribal communities, eat with them. Many tribal Hindus are non-vegetarian. Even within the broader Hindu community, while people often say Hindus are vegetarians, the reality is that the majority are not. And in Tripura, their leaders would eat everything; there was no controversy over it. Another example is from Kerala, though I don’t recall the exact year. In Kerala, beef consumption is widespread, among Muslims, Christians, and Hindus as well. Hindus are still the majority there. There was a BJP candidate—either in a Lok Sabha or Assembly election—who put up banners saying that if he won, he would ensure the supply of high-quality beef.

It says that it’s in their interest that they want only one force with whom they can directly deal with, bargain, and manage affairs.

In Telecom, in airlines, in media, in number of businesses, cement or infrastructure or electricity. But now, in the last decade, things are moving in the direction of this centralizing force through mergers and acquisitions, with only few big, corporate houses. Who are, in their nature, all-India. They are not just limited to either Tamil Nadu or Andhra Pradesh or based in those states and from there expanding. During the 1980s till the last decade, they were coming from these states and expanding nationally. They were, like, the regional political party sharing power with the government in Delhi. Similarly, a number of corporates were coming from these states and trying to expand themselves. Now, this trend has reversed. Like the political party at the centre accepting to share power with the regional party. Take the case of Adani, where Mumbai Airport was run by one South Indian company before, which were forced to sell it to the Adanis. Similarly in cement business, in electricity, in power, in coal, or in telecommunications, just see what is happening. Telecommunications is now completely monopolized by Ambani. Of course, Airtel is there, and Vodafone is there. But Vodafone is almost dying. Airtel is trying to compete, but initially the leader of the market is now number two in comparison to Jio.

This kind of social and political mobilization has not happened in many states. Wherever it was a feudal society for a long time, there was no movement in the society. You know, politics always reflects if there are churnings happening within the social groups. So, this was seen in Bihar, but it was not seen that much in UP.

When Atal Ji (Atal Bihari Vajpayee) was the president of the Bharatiya Janata Party and faced a crushing defeat in 1984, with the party winning only two seats, he, Advani Ji, and a few others went to watch a movie at night. The name of the movie was Phir Subah Hogi (There Will Be a New Dawn). They went on scooters, watched the movie, and came back saying to each other, ""We don’t need to worry. Though we have lost today, a new dawn will surely come tomorrow."" This story is often shared by Atal Ji and Advani Ji to remind everyone of the importance of hope and perseverance. The opposition today is in such deep frustration and is making reckless statements and decisions, which they should not be doing. Ups and downs are part of politics—sometimes the scales tip one way, sometimes another. Those in the opposition must work with courage and self-confidence. Another important point is that one should not oppose something just for the sake of opposing it. Merely being in the opposition doesn’t mean you should reject everything. For example, during the consecration ceremony of the Ram Temple, the opposition parties said, “We are in the opposition, so why should we attend?” But Lord Ram is a symbol of identity and inspiration, not just for India but for the whole world.

You may not be aware of this, but for our content to reach your home, we pay money. These service providers—like the ones I just mentioned—we pay them. A major national channel, among the top five, pays around 125 to 150 crore rupees annually to these providers. So, we pay from our side, and you pay from your side, and the middlemen profit from it. But in England, or in European countries, the system works differently. There, it doesn’t matter whether the government provides funding or not—our income is secured. The reason for this is that the money we pay to service providers is handled by a government system, which ensures that revenue is distributed according to viewership range. This means that we, as media houses, do not have to rely on private funding for our financial survival. That is why when you watch television in England, you see very few private advertisements—almost none at all. If a similar system were implemented here—where the media became financially self-sufficient—then the very next day, we would become capable of speaking the truth. The media has immense influence. Within seconds, we can reach every household with any issue. Do you understand what I am saying? What I mean is, the moment media becomes economically independent, its impact will be massive. The change would be so drastic that within days, you would start noticing a difference. And the reason behind this is simple: media can instantly deliver messages to every home. Whether it's electronic media, social media, or print media—when you wake up in the morning, a newspaper is already at your doorstep, delivering the intended message. On television, the moment something is broadcasted, it reaches your home within seconds. But the issue is, until we achieve financial independence, we are forced to think—if we show this, will it harm our financial stability? Will it impact our economy?",Media,Neutral,India,NA,Media,Mechanism,Both,Media fiscally dependent on the government -> subnational backsliding;Fiscally independent media -> immense influence -> no need to self censor -> subnational stability,Awareness,NA,4
R5,"Now, let me explain something very practical. What did I tell you earlier about the media? The first thing the media does is not journalism. The first thing we consider is how we will sustain ourselves, how our channel will survive, how we will generate income. That’s our primary focus. So, what happens? We look at the market. Now, suppose Mercedes-Benz wants to advertise with us. You understand, right? I will tell them, ""Look, our channel is very popular in Manipur."" But why would they advertise there? They barely sell five cars there in an entire year. So, even if our channel is popular in Manipur, why would we focus on Manipur? We would rather show news about Uttar Pradesh because that’s where electricity issues and infrastructure stories will gain more traction. That is why, if you look at any news channel, how many reports do you see on smaller states? The reason is market forces. When we sit down to analyze, the first thing we examine is which state has the most market potential. Now, let’s say a company wants to sell sattu (a traditional flour-based food). If our channel is popular in Tamil Nadu, why would they advertise sattu there? They wouldn’t, right?",Media,Neutral,India,NA,Media,Description,NA,Reporting dependent on market forces,NA,NA,3
R5,"So, you need to understand that media is an industry, and like any industry, its job is to generate revenue in whatever way possible. It is not a social service. Journalists are not walking around with a bag over their shoulders doing selfless reporting anymore. There was a time when they had respect, but they did not have money. Now, media is an industry, and like any industry, its job is to sustain itself and make money. That’s why, when my program airs, I check it afterward. I don’t focus on what content was delivered—I check how many views it got on YouTube. We don’t analyze whether the content was good, we analyze how many people watched it within the first hour. This is why media today is all about profit-making. Look at the news about Dhirendra Shastri—have you heard of him? He is a Baba (godman), and politicians bow before him. Wherever he goes, lakhs of people gather. If you go to him, he will write a slip and tell you what’s on your mind. But there was a time when for months, he dominated the news cycle, and no other topic was covered.",Media,Neutral,India,NA,Media,Description,NA,Reporting dependent on market forces,NA,NA,3
R5,"So yes, media coverage varies significantly. Media is just another industry. And like any industry, its primary function is to make money—how it makes money is another issue. There was a time when news aired for just 30 minutes on Doordarshan at 8:40 PM. But now, we have 24-hour news cycles, yet those 20 minutes of news back then covered more real issues than what we get in 24 hours today. Why? Because Doordarshan did not have to generate profit, but private channels do. Even government-owned media has changed. There was a time when government channels criticized the government itself. But today, they cannot do so. Let me tell you an inside fact: when a government news channel invites a guest for a debate, they thoroughly check their entire background. They scrutinize their social media to ensure they are not critical of the ruling party. Only if they seem ""safe"" are they invited. So, when there is no one left to criticize the government, then what can be expected? If no one is there to highlight the government’s mistakes, then what will change? And all of this boils down to one simple reason—money. If media becomes financially independent, I am telling you—half of the problems I have been discussing will disappear within days. If media becomes independent, things will change.",Media,Neutral,India,NA,Media,Description,DecreasesDemocracy,Media fiscally dependent on the government -> media does as the autocratizers ask -> subnational backsliding,NA,NA,5
R8,"Look, corporate media cannot be viewed as a uniform entity; there are nuances within it. However, when it comes to corporate media today, it has become completely aligned with the government. In a democracy, the role of the media is to hold the government accountable, to critique it, and to question its actions. But over the past 10 years, the role of media has shifted dramatically. Instead of questioning the ruling regime, they question the opposition. Even after 10 years of the current ruling party being in power, the media does not ask tough questions of them. Instead, they continue to focus on criticizing the previous regimes.",Civil,SFI,Delhi,NA,Media,Mechanism,DecreasesDemocracy,Media criticises opposition and not the autocratizers,NA,NA,3
R8,"The reporting pattern today is such that it heavily leans toward pro-Hindu narratives. The media shows what the government prefers to see and does not criticize it. This trend is particularly evident in corporate media, which is controlled by major industrialists. For instance, Adani owns media outlets, Ambani owns media outlets, and both are aligned with the government. In such a scenario, it is unrealistic to expect these media houses to criticize the government—they won’t. Media, too, is a business; they need to survive. Much of their revenue comes from the government. Critical media, on the other hand, receives little to no government revenue. As a result, the corporate media stands firmly with the government and promotes a pro-Hindu stance. It no longer serves the democratic function of questioning those in power. Instead, it has become a tool to amplify government narratives and sideline dissent.",Civil,SFI,Delhi,NA,Media,Descriptive,Both,Corporate media aligned with the autocratizing party;Critical media does question government narratives but may have much less funding,NA,NA,4
R8,"At that time [the previous regime], there was space for criticism. It’s not that corporate media was always pro-poor or pro-people, but there was heterogeneity within the media. People with different ideologies worked in the same media houses. That is not the case today. Either such individuals have been removed by corporate media, sidelined to the point of being voiceless, or they are forced to say and write what their companies dictate, aligning with the government’s stance, just to keep their jobs. During the previous regime, corporate media existed as well—it’s not that it didn’t. Back then, there were groups like Hindustan Times and Times of India. In the television space, corporate media was already dominant. But the influence of corporates, especially in TV media, has increased significantly, and consolidation has taken place. For example, I remember that Reliance, under Ambani, acquired Network 18 during the UPA regime. When the Anna Hazare movement was underway—Arvind Kejriwal and the India Against Corruption team—the entire media portrayed them as heroes. Anna Hazare, Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and others were called the ""five Pandavas."" The government, on the other hand, was portrayed as Dhritarashtra—a blind and corrupt ruler. This imagery was quite popular in the media back then. The media prominently highlighted allegations of corruption, like the 2G scam and the coal scam, demanding answers from the government and putting it on trial in the public eye. Essentially, the government was declared guilty in the media court. However, later developments showed that many of these allegations did not hold up legally, and the accused were acquitted in cases like the coal scam. So even within corporate media at the time, there was enough space for taking anti-establishment stances. Some media outlets were pro-government, but many questioned the ruling regime, holding it accountable. That is what the media’s role is supposed to be. However, post-2014, this space has disappeared. The same corporate media is still there, but with increased corporate consolidation, especially in electronic media. Now, the media has clearly decided that it will not question the government. Instead, it will only question the opposition",Civil,SFI,Delhi,NA,Media,Descriptive,Both,During previous regime -> more pluralism in voices within corporate media -> highlighted issues critical of the government -> held rulers accountable -> now the space has disappeared,NA,NA,5
