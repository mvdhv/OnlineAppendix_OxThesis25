R1,"The greatest beauty of democracy is the opposition. The opposition is the very essence of democracy. To maintain the fabric of democracy, a strong opposition is crucial.",Democracy_Features,Procedural_Democracy,Government,SP,Uttar_Pradesh,The remark comes from someone who is currently a member of the opposition themselves.,NA,"Field notes corroborate that the respondent put emphatic emphasis on the role of the opposition in democracy, reiterating it multiple times throughout the interview."
R2,"The literal meaning is that the government is selected by the people of the country. That’s the literal meaning of a democracy—where the people of the country elect the government. And you have a system, like the US follows a different presidential system, in India we follow a different political system. Here, we have elections at various levels—from Panchayat level to urban development level and then to the [state] legislative to the Parliament level.",Democracy_Features,Procedural_Democracy,Media,Neutral,Uttar_Pradesh,Respondent draws attention to the US context to explain democracy in India. Also the context of multi-level democracy.,NA,"Textbook definition, but does draw attention to multi-level elections as a constitutive part of democracy."
R2,"But generally, people think that in villages, people don’t understand democracy. I think illiteracy has nothing to do with political literacy. They are more [politically] intelligent, they participate more, and there were leaders who used to say that election is a festival where everybody goes, and with that spirit, they go and they go in groups and vote. So, to say that the illiterate lot, which now has come down drastically, they don’t understand democracy will be wrong. The only thing is that they don’t use the word democracy—for them, it’s the electoral system.",Democracy_Features,Procedural_Democracy,Media,Neutral,Uttar_Pradesh,"The context of class differences in electoral participation is being used to highlight that the understanding of democracy among the masses in India remains tied largely to the act of voting. Additionally, there is the context of an assumed relationship between class and (political) literacy at lower levels.","It may be instructive to note that although the respondent is highlighting the active and intelligent voting behaviour of lower class people, they still use terms like ""the illiterate lot"" to refer to them, thus still exhibiting certain preconceived notions.","Field notes indicate that the respondent was moderately passionate about ""correcting"" a popular misconception regarding democratic awareness amongst poor people."
R11,"Then, democracy is also about how competitive and open it is. It means that the bar should not be too high for the entry of new political forces. For example, in the period from 1989 to 2014, of coalition governments, at that time, the bar was a little lower. It allowed a number of political parties and groups to contest elections, get space in government or power. After 2014, it has shrunk at the national level...For democracy to survive, you need fierce, competitive politics.",Democracy_Features,Procedural_Democracy,Media,Neutral,India,The respondent refers to coalition governments as a political and historical context in which the entry barriers were lower and democratic competition was higher.,NA,Highlights features as well as trends in democracy.
R11,"But of course, party politics and ideology is also important in democracy. But it must be very competitive, it must be very diverse and plural in nature. So, it seems to me that democracy means it’s an evolving system.",Democracy_Features,Procedural_Democracy,Media,Neutral,India,References to the importance of party politics and ideology; frames democracy in the context of its evolution.,NA,Highlights diversity and pluralism of political competition as additional features of democracy.
R11,"It is true that a prominent feature of India's democracy is that it has five-yearly elections, which is credited with the fact that elections are held regularly and are largely free and fair, except in some states. Conducting free and fair elections every five years and changing the government without shedding any blood or violence is the biggest achievement of Indian democracy.",Democracy_Features,Procedural_Democracy,Media,Neutral,India,Context of elections being free and fair in more states than not.,NA,Highlights free and fair elections as well as peaceful transfer of power as achievements of democracy.
R12,"Democracy whatever it means to you, same thing to me—government of the people, for the people, by the people. It’s a cliche definition, but that’s what it is. This means, I don't have a separate, individual, unique definition for India. It's the people's government. It should be for people, and they should have the last word in its formation and in its policies.",Democracy_Features,Procedural_Democracy,Bureaucrat,Neutral,Delhi,NA,NA,NA
R12,"The role of elections is very important, no doubt. Without elections there is no democracy. But one thing has to be understood: a good election is not a guarantee of good democracy.",Democracy_Features,Procedural_Democracy,Bureaucrat,Neutral,Delhi,NA,NA,"Respondent does note that while elections may be a necessary condition of democracy, they are not sufficient for normatively ""good"" democracy."
R13,"The periodic elections every five years inspire immense public trust. The people believe that if the government they elected does not perform well, they can replace it in five years. This belief has significantly shaped our democracy.",Democracy_Features,Procedural_Democracy,Party,BJP,Uttarakhand,There is an implicit context of performance assessment of the government by the public in democracy.,NA,The regular nature of elections and turnover highlighted as features of democracy.
R14,"Democracy, in essence, means freedom and the ability to make choices. Every five years, elections are held where people can freely choose their representatives, whether MPs at the national level or MLAs at the state level. When MLAs are elected, they form the state government if they achieve a majority. Similarly, MPs elected across the country form the central government. The party with the majority selects the Prime Minister. In a democracy, the most significant power lies in the vote, which is given by the people. The public places its trust in individuals or parties they believe will work for their benefit. They elect them, whether for an MP or MLA position. This is the essence of democracy: empowering the people to choose their representatives and place them in positions of responsibility.",Democracy_Features,Procedural_Democracy,Government,BJP,Uttarakhand,Context of elections at the state level and the national level in democracy.,NA,"Again, textbook definition, but the second person to draw attention to multi-level elections as a constitutive part of democracy."
R14,"The security of democracy lies in people using their votes impartially. It should not be that democracy is showcased as an illusion, while the process of voting is not transparent. It is often heard that people lose trust in the system. It is essential that voting is conducted impartially, without any manipulation. The decision made by the public must be reflected on the ground.",Democracy_Features,Procedural_Democracy,Government,BJP,Uttarakhand,"There is a broader context of elections or votes being manipulated or not remaining ""impartial"", but it is hard to decipher what constitutes impartiality to the respondent.","The victory of the BJPs counts as ""impartial"" voting to the respondent since it reflects the decision made by the public on the ground. At the same time, they allege that the opposition in certain other states are not transparent or impartial with conducting their voting process.","On the one hand, it is highlighting transparency and fairness in elections as necessary for sustaining trust in democracy. On the other hand, it is unclear what actually meets those criteria."
R17,"Look, democracy means ""of the people, for the people."" It is a system where people are directly involved in governance. It is what we call ""Janatantra"" — a government of the people. The public elects their representatives, those representatives then run the government, and that government works for the welfare of the people. Basically, it’s a cycle.",Democracy_Features,Procedural_Democracy,Government,BJP,Uttarakhand,There is an implicit context of the government working for the welfare of the people in a democracy.,NA,Second person to echo the exact Lincolnian definition of democracy.
R19,"The establishment of democracy in our country is in accordance with the Constitution. In a democracy, people vote to elect their government, and the government, once elected, works for the welfare of the people. You could say it is a system of governance chosen by the people for the people.",Democracy_Features,Procedural_Democracy,Government,INC,Uttarakhand,"Again, there is an implicit context of the government working for the welfare of the people in a democracy.",NA,Echoes almost the exact same sentiments as well as phrasing of R17. Third person to join in the Lincolnian definition of democracy. 
R22,"The word ""loktantra"" is a sacred term. In English, we call it ""democracy,"" and in Hindi, loktantra means governance by the people. It is built with the participation of the people, and respecting the sentiments of the people is the most important aspect of democracy because it is created by their votes.",Democracy_Features,Procedural_Democracy,Party,INC,Uttarakhand,NA,NA,Draws attention to the participation of the people in democracy.
R4,"Since I come from a village, I see that the real meaning of democracy, as envisioned in our Constitution, lies in concepts like Gram Swaraj (village self-rule) and the Panchayati Raj system. These are considered the essence of democracy.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Media,Neutral,India,Context of village background.,NA,"A very bottom-up, decentralised understanding of democracy. Third person to do so."
R4,"What is the essence of the democratic process? It is to convert the population into citizens. If we were to define democracy in one line, it would be: turning the population into active citizens. As citizens, people have both duties and rights—responsibilities and entitlements.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Media,Neutral,India,Context of citizenship and fundamental rights and duties as defined in the Constitution.,NA,Democracy defined as the substantive process of governmentality almost.
R5,"For me, democracy is exactly what is defined in our Constitution—whatever the Constitution says about fundamental rights, duties, and democracy. If you ask me whether I agree with this definition of democracy, I would say, for me, democracy is whatever is written in the Indian Constitution.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Media,Neutral,India,Context of fundamental rights and duties as defined in the Constitution.,NA,NA
R6,"The meaning of democracy is that every person, regardless of their political party, caste, or religion, should have the opportunity to act according to their own will.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Government,JMM,Jharkhand,NA,NA,Democracy as freedom.
R6,"Democracy is a form of governance, a system, a structure that, in today's time, exists as a constitutional arrangement. However, it is not just a social system. You see, there are two distinct entities—the state and society. Society has its own order, while the state has its own governance and administration. Democracy is a way of governance, but it is also a way of life. Specifically, when we speak of democracy in the social order, we must consider it from the perspective of democratic culture and constitutional principles.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Government,JMM,Jharkhand,NA,NA,Juxtaposition of a constitutional and a cultural understanding of democracy.
R6,"When I was young, I saw how, if a wedding took place in a village, the entire village would take collective responsibility for it. Nothing was brought from outside. Whether it was milk, buttermilk, or other necessities, everything was contributed by the people of the village. Everyone shared their belongings—beds, mattresses, household items—willingly. In my childhood, I remember how we would go door to door collecting beds and mattresses for weddings. The entire event was organized without any marketplace involvement. Everything was done through mutual cooperation. This cooperative way of life, where work was done with mutual consent and collective effort, was in itself democracy. In today's democracy, decision-making is based on a majority, but in earlier times, decisions were based on consensus. There was no concept of voting with a show of hands; rather, if a consensus could not be reached, there was acceptance (sweekriti), even if not complete agreement (sahmati). If there were ten people in a discussion, and eight agreed while two disagreed, the two would not resist but would say, ""We do not fully agree, but we accept the decision."" There was no culture of outright opposition; rather, it was about mutual acceptance.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Government,JMM,Jharkhand,Context of village background.,NA,"Democracy as cooperation, consensus, and mutual acceptance. Emphasises the lack of ""outright opposition"", which is interesting coming from a member of the opposition themselves.  "
R6,"This is the essence of democracy: a system where dialogue is possible, where open discussions take place, where thoughts are exchanged, and where decisions are made collectively. Democracy means that people engage in discussion (vichar), make decisions (nirnay), and then implement those decisions (kriya). These three elements—discussion, decision, and action—define governance. The same applies to the government.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Government,JMM,Jharkhand,NA,NA,The same respondent is now highlighting a deliberative understanding of democracy.
R6,"In reality, the existence of all entities lies within democracy itself. If we look at it closely, everyone’s existence is sustained through democracy, and any crisis in democracy is a crisis for everyone’s existence. Broadly speaking, democracy grants you the right to make decisions within your own sphere. That is its fundamental essence. It guarantees social, economic, and political justice, provides freedom of worship, freedom of residence, opportunities, and dignity. This is what democracy is. In the Indian Constitution, it is expressed in the form of justice, liberty, and equality. But this is not just a concept of the Indian Constitution; it is deeply embedded in Indian culture.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Government,JMM,Jharkhand,NA,NA,"Back to the understanding of democracy as freedom and justice, and as a juxtaposition of constitution and culture."
R6,"The very foundation of Indian culture is coexistence. Coexistence means that people can live together in harmony. This idea of coexistence is what defines Indian culture, and our culture is deeply rooted in this principle. The very essence of Indian culture is found in the village, which is why it is said that the soul of India resides in its villages. Villages represent family and neighborhood, coexistence and mutual dependence. This interconnected existence is democracy itself. We keep emphasizing the significance of the village because it is here that people live together, care for each other, and seek solutions that benefit all equally. This is the essence of democracy. It is about having the right to make decisions within one’s own domain, and when that domain expands, decision-making becomes collective. Individual leadership and collective leadership both coexist within this framework. If one were to deeply research this and conduct an extensive study, scientifically, many profound insights would emerge. My point is simply that all these elements are deeply ingrained in democracy.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Government,JMM,Jharkhand,NA,NA,"Democracy  is indeed multifaceted for this respondent. It is coexistence, justice, freedom, liberty, dialogue, mutual understanding, and so on."
R8,"If we take fundamental rights as a basis, for example, the right to practice any religion, the right to worship in one’s own way, and the right to propagate one's religion—this can be a major parameter.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Civil,SFI,Delhi,Context of fundamental rights as defined in the Constitution.,NA,NA
R9,"Democracy means ""everyone together, everyone’s progress."" (Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas). This is the essence of democracy. The difference between democracy and monarchy is that, in a democracy, the son of a peon or a tea seller can also reach the highest seat of power, while in a monarchy, this is not possible.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Party,BJP,India,"""Sabka saath, sabka vikaas"" is a slogan from the manifesto of the BJP. Also, the journey of Modi from being a tea seller to the Prime Minister is being used to justify the place of democracy. ",NA,Their definition of democracy is both intertwined with the developmental motto of the BJP and in opposition to monarchy.
R9,"India’s democratic system is unique in that no one is superior or inferior to anyone else. Our Constitution is designed in such a way that external forces cannot directly impose decisions on us, nor can anyone within the country unilaterally seize power. Let me give an example: when a notification is issued by the Honorable President of India, it first requires approval from the Cabinet led by the Prime Minister, and only then does the President sign it. This is a key difference between India and neighboring countries like Pakistan, Burma (Myanmar), and Nepal. In those nations, power is often seized by force, typically by the military. In India, such a scenario is impossible. The military does not dominate the nation, nor does the nation dominate the military; there is a perfect balance. India’s democracy ensures that everyone plays their role—whether it is the government, the judiciary, or any other institution. The government performs its responsibilities, the judiciary handles justice, and the military safeguards the nation without interfering in governance. This balance is the hallmark of true democracy.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Party,BJP,India,Context of comparison with neighbouring countries to highlight India's experience with democracy.,NA,"It is interesting that a member of the ruling party criticised with undermining the democracy of India through the concentration of power at the national level is also the one highlighting balance of powers as essential for democracy, even going to the extent of specifying that the Constitution does not allow anyone to dominate the nation. Perhaps this only extends to the military for the respondent. Also, it will become clear as we go on that many respondents from the BJP tend to repeatedly compare Indian democracy with the lack of democracy in neighbouring countries as a testament to its strength and continued existence."
R9,"There is a symbiotic relationship between development and democracy. By symbiotic, I mean that one cannot truly exist without the other—they are interdependent…. Democracy means giving everyone the freedom to voice their opinions and concerns. However, democracy alone cannot satisfy people's needs without development. When development occurs, people’s grievances naturally reduce, and the voices of dissatisfaction start diminishing. That’s why development must progress hand-in-hand with democracy. Without development, democracy would lose its essence because it would fail to address the needs of the people.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Party,BJP,India,"Context of ""Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas"" in the BJP's manifesto being important to the emphasis on development.",NA,NA
R9,"The basic criterion is that we should retain the right to express ourselves freely, without anyone suppressing us. Suppression means that no one should dominate us. We should be able to pursue our own development, gain education, work anywhere in the country or the world, and live freely. Without democracy, under systems like monarchy, you cannot act as per your own will. In a democracy, you can work freely while adhering to the state's rules. Without democracy, where authoritarianism prevails, you must act only according to the will of those in power, and you lack personal freedom. For instance, if you go to Thailand—a highly developed area where people travel for various purposes, including leisure—you will find it is a monarchy. There, it is mandatory to display the king's photo in every shop or restaurant. People are forced to display it. In India, however, it’s not mandatory to display the Prime Minister or President's photo everywhere except in government offices. This is the key difference between a democracy and a monarchy—democracy allows freedom, while monarchy imposes restrictions.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Party,BJP,India,Compares the context of mandatory person worship in Thailand under monarchy to the lack thereof under Indian democracy.,"The respondent asserted that it is not mandatory to play the PM's photo in India except in government offices. I then asked him about the directive of the government which made it compulsory for any public event to display the photo of the PM, as well as the immense public advertisements by the BJP which essentially did make it so that the PM's photo is in every public space such as metros. To this, the respondent only had to say that the people did this voluntarily out of their love for the PM.",NA
R10,"Every person in India has his own glasses to see democracy… Mostly, this is a highly misunderstood concept where people think that only casting their vote once in every five years in elections is democracy. I believe that simply voting once every five years is not democracy. After voting, in the remaining 365 into 5 minus 1 days that are left, meeting the eyes of the person you elected after casting your vote, asking questions of them, and holding them responsible and accountable for their acts, that is democracy. And this is what gives power to a country, a nation, a society or a group of citizens—not just by voting once. This is a practical definition.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Government,AAP,Delhi,"Respondent's definition of democracy is somewhat tied to the context of his membership in the AAP, which also advocates for a service-based politics in its manifesto.",NA,NA
R10,"MP/MLAs should be like postmen: those who bring public problems to the cabinet, bring them to the house, and legislate such policies which address these problems. This is the purest form of democracy.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Government,AAP,Delhi,Same context of party membership.,NA,NA
R11,"Because if seen from the perspective of academic training, democracy is multifaceted. It’s not just about electing your representative every five years, it’s deliberative, it’s also giving space to many social movements, political movements, movements which are beyond party politics.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Media,Neutral,India,"Ties it to the context of recent protests being necessary for democracy in India, such as Farmers protest, Shaheen Bagh protests, and so on. ",NA,"Democracy highlighted as multifaceted: deliberative, inclusive, mobilization, and so on."
R11,"Democracy has a very wide definition. Everyone should be included, I think… That, in the overall picture of democracy, which has publics in different sections of the society—either caste, or class, or ethnicities—whether they are able to find their space or not.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Media,Neutral,India,NA,NA,NA
R11,"See, because ultimately, democracy in India by nature is about championing and allowing the expression of regional sentiments or regional forces. So, the idea of democracy, you know, is strengthened if regional aspirations are allowed or given space to express themselves. Number one.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Media,Neutral,India,Context of regional politics,NA,Highlights that space for regional aspirations and political forces is important for democracy. The fourth person to do so now.
R11,"And for India, I think many people value its institutional dimension—that is, independent institutions, particularly judiciary and media. These are the two key institutions...very important in democracy apart from the other three. Second, the issue of accountability is also very important. Accountability of the legislature as well as other institutions to the public.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Media,Neutral,India,NA,NA,Institutions and their accountability also highlited as important for democracy.
R11,"I think we should all strive for free and fair elections, independent institutions, including an independent judiciary and critical media, social and political movements. These are the important factors that if they are getting strengthened, I think democracy in India will survive. But if these tendencies are crushed and unable to find proper space, democracy is in danger.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Media,Neutral,India,NA,NA,NA
R13,"That is one aspect—choosing representatives based on voting. Another important aspect is that once a government is formed, even with a majority, it remains concerned about whether its actions are acceptable to the people, whether the public will approve them. There is a constant fear within governments that opposition parties will highlight any shortcomings or mistakes, which could damage their popularity. They fear creating an image in the public that suggests they are unfit to govern.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Party,BJP,Uttarakhand,NA,NA,"Respondent highlights the role of accountability and more importantly of the opposition, despite being affiliated with the incumbent."
R13,"This fear extends to elected representatives as well, such as Members of Legislative Assemblies (MLAs). Every MLA worries about how they can secure re-election, about how to maintain or build their popularity among the public. While some succeed in this effort, others fail. But some go on to win repeatedly, serving multiple terms—three, four, five, even eight times. For example, in Dehradun, there was Harbans Kapoor, who served as an MLA for eight terms and remained in office until his death. This shows how representatives, influenced by or fearful of this democratic system, strive to adhere to its core principles—engaging with the public, solving their problems, and addressing their grievances.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Party,BJP,Uttarakhand,Context of Dehradun state elections,"The respondent highlighted throughout that an important part of democracy is being able to vote out incumbents who do not perform well. At the same time, the example they give to demonstrate their point is one of the incumbent not being voted out and managing to stay in power for several terms, which to them is strong democracy. I do not understand how this demonstrates representatives always being fearful of the public, especially since we do not hear whether that MLA actually served the people well or not.",NA
R13,"Leaders here are often available at any hour. For example, if someone in a neighbourhood doesn't have water, they might call their representative at 7:30 AM. The representative must attend to the call; if not, they risk being criticized. Even at 10 PM, if there's a dispute in someone's home, people will call their MLA, asking them to contact the police. The MLA must take the call, even late at night. I have seen representatives attend to emergencies at 1 or 2 AM, going to police stations or standing by their constituents to fight for their rights. This is the strength of our democracy—that our representatives, elected by the people, are directly accountable to the public.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Party,BJP,Uttarakhand,Personal and anecdotal experiences,"I do want to point out one thing. The respondent makes it a point to emphasise how one of the strengths of Indian democracy is that MLAs and politicians are available to the public 24/7 on call, including themselves. But in my own experience, I could not get in touch with them through cell or email for many weeks until finally resorting to contacts in their networks to secure an interview.",NA
R13,"Whether in urban areas like municipalities and municipal corporations, or in states through legislative assemblies, or at the national level in the Lok Sabha, this accountability is embedded in the system. As our democracy and Constitution have completed 75 years, we see a gradual increase in public awareness and the sense of responsibility among representatives toward their constituents. This accountability strengthens with time, forming the backbone of our democracy.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Party,BJP,Uttarakhand,NA,NA,NA
R17,"One of the great features of democracy is the provision of reservations. This ensures that different segments of society are represented, allowing everyone’s voice to reach the system. Based on the needs of these groups, rules and policies can be created so that everyone has equal opportunities to grow and move forward. This inclusivity is one of the greatest beauties of our democracy.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Government,BJP,Uttarakhand,Context of reservations and the respondent being a sitting MLA of an SC reserved seat themselves. ,NA,Reservations are necessary for democracy as proxy for inclusivity.
R18,"The word ""democracy"" is a very significant term. Since India gained independence in 1947, this word has been widely used. Today, as we live in a democratic system, I believe that democracy is closely aligned with our Constitution and laws. Essentially, democracy is what we also call ""prajatantra"" (rule of the people).",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Government,BJP,Uttarakhand,NA,NA,NA
R18,"The most essential aspect of democracy is that there should be development for everyone. There should be unity, collective progress, and mutual support in times of joy and sorrow.

R18,"I don’t think anyone can truly be contrary to democracy because, if someone opposes democracy, how can they be considered a citizen of India? Democracy allows people to express a variety of sentiments. Everyone has the freedom to voice their feelings, and doing so is not wrong. However, these sentiments can sometimes head in the wrong direction. It then becomes the responsibility of senior citizens or experienced representatives to guide and educate them.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Government,BJP,Uttarakhand,NA,"It is interesting that the respondent first asserts that everyone has the freedom to voice their feelings in a democracy but also places a premium on not leading your sentiments in the ""wrong"" direction as well as highlighting that the knowledge of right or wrong direction is perhaps best found in senior citizens or experienced representatives.",NA
R19,"What happens in democracy is that, during elections, parties present a manifesto, make promises to the people, and then try to fulfil those promises.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Government,INC,Uttarakhand,NA,NA,NA
R22,"We live in a federal system—India is a Union of States, a collection of diverse states. The people of every state have given their mandate in favour of governance. Therefore, they must be allowed to run a clean, transparent, and stable government without interference. The most critical point is to allow governments to fulfil the promises they have made to the people.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Party,INC,Uttarakhand,NA,NA,Fifth person to highlight in some way that democracy consists of decentralised politics.
R23,"Look, the definition itself is for the people, by the people, of the people. Where is ""the people"" in this? It’s a system run by the people for themselves. If you explain it, the beauty of democracy lies in the fact that elections are held every five years. The purpose behind this was likely that voting should be based on merit, and this would put pressure on elected representatives, whom we call servants of the people, to perform well, focus on development, and work on what is necessary for the people. The soul of democracy is precisely this: there should be good governance by the people for the people. Rules and laws should be made in line with the times, and changes should be made to laws as needed. The public should vote not based on caste, religion, or region but on the basis of work and performance.",Democracy_Features,Substantive_Democracy,Party,INC,Uttarakhand,NA,NA,Fourth person to include a Lincolnian definition of democracy. It is largely procedural but they do end up highlighting good governance and performance-based voting as the soul of democracy.  
R1,"Today, one of the biggest threats to democracy is education. Privatization has taken over education, and children are no longer attending primary schools. When education and healthcare are handed over to private hands, what can we do? The government should focus its efforts on education and healthcare, but it isn’t doing anything about them.",Democracy_Trends,Service_Dissatisfaction,Government,SP,Uttar_Pradesh,"Context of increasing privatisation might be important, especially since the respondent is affiliated with the Samajwadi Party.",NA,"The first subtheme, including this response, is indicative of growing concerns about the poor service delivery of the government distorting democracy."
R5,"This [democracy] varies from level to level, depending on one’s social status. If we talk about the lower strata—people who are oppressed or struggling—they don’t even know what democracy or the Constitution actually is. As you move upward, when you reach the lower-middle class, you will find that they are frustrated with the definition of democracy. They feel frustrated because, while the Constitution speaks beautifully about democracy, in reality, they receive nothing. It is like being shown millions but only receiving pennies. This segment of lower-middle and middle-class people appears disillusioned. As for the upper class, what the Constitution says doesn’t really matter to them. They know very well that in today’s world, whatever the Constitution may declare, if they have money, they can bend the system to their will. So, I categorize democracy into these three levels.",Democracy_Trends,Service_Dissatisfaction,Media,Neutral,India,NA,NA,"According to this respondent, it seems like the declining trends in democracy are being felt the most by the middle class who are unable to receive crucial services. They do not single out a single party for the decline in democracy."
R5,"Now, take a look—what does our Constitution or our democracy say? It states that democracy is a government ""for the people, by the people, and of the people."" Fair enough. The procedure takes place—elections are held, people choose their representatives, and the process is completed. But once this process is over, somewhere along the line, democratic rights and principles start to break down. Because once you elect someone, you then have to stand before them with folded hands, pleading, ""Please do something for me, please look into my issue, please take action."" But nothing actually happens. For me, if we look at it today, in contrast to the first two decades after independence—say, from 1946 to 1957 and then from 1957 to 1967—the people who entered politics back then had a sense of service. Now, you will hardly find that element at all.",Democracy_Trends,Service_Dissatisfaction,Media,Neutral,India,"Historical context employed to demonstrate a decline in the ""sense of service"" in the government.",NA,"For this respondent, elections do take place but ""democratic rights and principles"" start to break down after elections. Maybe due to government unresponsivess, maybe due to the suppression of the opposition, both reasons cited by this respondent."
R7,"On the other hand, those to whom power has been delegated still face an issue: historically, people were either subjects under a ruler or colonial rule, meaning they were not citizens in the true sense. They were never educated in citizenship. So today, even though they are no longer slaves or subjects, they have not fully become citizens either. Instead, they have become mere beneficiaries. The entire country has turned into beneficiaries of schemes rather than active participants in governance. The ruling powers are exploiting this reality in every election. Elections have become about what benefits will be provided—electricity bills will be waived, financial handouts will be given, and every person stands with their hand out, expecting something. This beneficiary mentality has reached such an extent that even voting is influenced by it. People now consider which party or candidate will offer them the most—whether one will give them 1000 or another will offer 4000, or if they will receive free liquor. If you visit villages and ask questions, you will often hear, ""What will we get?"" Instead of developing historical consciousness, what has emerged is a deeply entrenched expectation of benefits. So, the real challenge now is: how do we instill in people the awareness that they are owners of this country? How do we create that consciousness within them? If this does not happen, no matter how many constitutional provisions we implement, it will not lead to meaningful change. In fact, instead of improving governance, things may further deteriorate at the grassroots level.",Democracy_Trends,Service_Dissatisfaction,Civil,Neutral,India,"Context of vote buying, but not specified exactly where is it occuring.

Concerns of service delivery merely existing in the form of freebies and handouts, and even vote buying."
R7,"If we look at it from a general perspective today, on the surface, it appears that people have become so entangled in incentives and benefits that they do not really desire freedom—the freedom to make their own decisions. When a person has the power to make decisions, they also have to rely on their own efforts and strength to sustain themselves. But the prevailing sentiment today is that someone else should make decisions for them, provide them with all necessities, and allow them to live in comfort, without worry. They wish for food to be served to them rather than learning to fish for themselves. There is a fundamental difference between these two approaches. From a broader perspective, it seems that with the rising competition to become mere beneficiaries, democracy itself is at risk.",Democracy_Trends,Service_Dissatisfaction,Civil,Neutral,India,NA,NA,"Democracy is at risk because the government is playing into the politics of handouts instead of teaching the people to fish for themselves. From the field notes I have, it is clear that the respondent feels strongly about people not having the freedom to make their own decisions for economic empowerment under the current regime. They do not elaborate, however, on what alternative economic arrangements the government should be providing to the public. Also, they do not necessarily hold a single party accountable for this ""beneficiary mentality"" and point it as a pervasive problem in Indian politics."

R23,"Another [present] narrative is to divert focus from important issues like development, education, hospitals, and unemployment. Over the past six years, whenever an incident gains attention and media begins discussing it, within a day or two, another major event is created to shift the media's focus elsewhere.

R1,"Politics is also the feeling of service that is born in us. We started politics with this feeling but the scenario of politics has changed. Because now politics has started happening in the name of religion, politics has started happening in the name of caste. Now politics does not happen in the name of service. Now politics has started happening in the name of temple and mosque in the country. What can we do now?",Democracy_Trends,Communalism,Government,SP,Uttar_Pradesh,Context of the inaugration of Ram Mandir in Uttar Pradesh.,NA,"According to field notes, respondent clearly conveyed a sense of helplessness at the growing use of religion in politics by the BJP. But it should be mentioned that the party the respondent is affiliated with is often accused of playing caste politics, particularly with the Yadav communities."
R5,"Look, first of all, we have the People's Representation Act, which lays down the rules for anyone contesting elections or participating in the political process—what they can and cannot do. It specifies that you cannot: Ask for votes based on caste or community; Use a political platform to address or appeal to a specific caste, community, or religion; Ignite religious sentiments from a political stage. These are just a few of the do’s and don’ts outlined in the act. But what actually happens after that? If you look at Indian democracy and Indian elections, whether in Bihar, South India, or elsewhere, you’ll see that every election involves some level of identity-based voting. If you’re in Bihar, votes are sought in the name of caste. If you’re in Uttar Pradesh, votes are sought in the name of caste. If you’re in South India, votes are sought in the name of Dalits vs. Upper Castes. Even the party names themselves reflect this divide. If you go to Hyderabad, you’ll see the same pattern. So, right at the starting point of the democratic process—where democracy is supposed to begin—we are the ones stopping it. That’s where it ends.",Democracy_Trends,Communalism,Media,Neutral,India,"Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Hyderabad singled out as important contexts for caste politics.",NA,"Respondent did not single out a specific party or context, just highlighted caste politics as a pervasive reason for decline in democracy."
R8,"I said it earlier—it’s fashionable. Let me explain this with an example. The current regime in India, led by the BJP, or more accurately the Sangh Parivar (RSS being its ideological backbone), claims to uphold democracy. Let’s consider Gandhi, the Father of the Nation. Personally, I don’t fully agree with his philosophy, but there’s no doubt he was the biggest mass leader of the Indian freedom movement. He mobilized the masses, fought against the British, and played a pivotal role in India’s independence. Now, who assassinated Gandhi? Nathuram Godse. And which ideology did Godse subscribe to? He was linked to the Hindu Mahasabha, an ideology close to the RSS. Today, our Prime Minister pays tribute to both Gandhi and Godse. It’s contradictory because Gandhi and Godse stand for entirely opposing values. Internationally, when our Prime Minister visits, he lays wreaths at Gandhi’s statues, praises him in speeches, and uses Gandhi’s name to validate his leadership. But domestically, his party and the Sangh Parivar promote values that are diametrically opposed to Gandhi’s. Why does this happen? Because Gandhi lends legitimacy. His name carries immense weight, both nationally and globally. The irony is that they publicly praise Gandhi while also glorifying Godse within certain circles. Now, why do they prefer to call themselves democrats? Because no regime—democratic or authoritarian—can afford to openly declare itself as authoritarian. In today’s interconnected world, legitimacy is paramount. If they were to openly adopt an authoritarian identity, their legitimacy would come under question globally. Even authoritarian regimes often speak the language of democracy. They champion democratic values, at least in rhetoric, because doing otherwise would delegitimize them in the eyes of the international community. That’s precisely what we’re witnessing here. An authoritarian agenda is cloaked in democratic terminology to maintain its validity and acceptance.",Democracy_Trends,Communalism,Civil,SFI,Delhi,Context of Hindu nationalism,NA,"Respondent highlights a very interesting idea regarding the politics played by the BJP. Although they claim that democracy has clearly been undermined under the BJP using the polarising Hindutva politics of Godse, they describe how the Prime Minister still claims to uphold democratic principles by invoking Gandhi. Dualism of undertaking authoritarianism while maintaining a democratic facade to maintain legitimacy of rule in popular consciousness. "
R8,"A right-wing party is in power at the center, and its governments also control these states. This is a party that promotes Hindu nationalism and ethnic nationalism, so naturally, their democratic approach takes a particular form. One interesting aspect of Indian democracy is that it is gradually transforming into an ethnic democracy. Now, how does such a party mobilize its base? If it does not pitch Hindus against Muslims, how will it consolidate its support? It has to do this; it is an essential part of its strategy.",Democracy_Trends,Communalism,Civil,SFI,Delhi,Context of Hindu nationalism,NA,Increasing religious polarisation and us versus them politics being played by the BJP highlighted.
R8,"Now, how do they unite Hindus? One way would be to eliminate caste altogether—to ensure that Brahmins, Thakurs, Rajputs, and all other castes sit together, eat together, and share property equally so that there is no economic disparity. Ideally, there should be no untouchability, everyone should have equal rights, and inter-caste marriages should become common. But Hinduism is not a civil religion, so this is a difficult path. Reform is a long and challenging process, one that requires eliminating all differences. This is a difficult road to take. There is, however, an easier route: find a large external enemy. If an enemy can be identified, then people can be mobilized against it. Who can serve as the common enemy? It could be people belonging to another religion—Muslims or Christians—who live in India with a distinct identity. The BJP targets religious minorities who maintain a strong identity and religious distinctiveness and portrays them as enemies. They draw upon historical incidents, highlight selective narratives, and use these to create mobilization. This is the simpler path.",Democracy_Trends,Communalism,Civil,SFI,Delhi,Context of Hindu nationalism,NA,"Again, religious polarisation manufactured by the ruling BJP highligted as the reason for decline in national democracy."
R8,"Now, I am not saying that what they are doing is equivalent to Hitler’s persecution of Jews, where an entire population was systematically exterminated. That is not happening. And it is not as if they will go down that path, because the Muslim population in India is massive—200 million. They cannot simply be wiped out like grass. They will have to remain, and the BJP knows this. But within a majoritarian Hindu framework, they will do whatever they want to the minorities. Whether this ultimately leads to a formalized Hindu majoritarian state is hard to say at this moment. One thing is certain—democratic backsliding is significant. The authoritarian tendencies are clearly visible. The direction in which things are moving is obvious.",Democracy_Trends,Communalism,Civil,SFI,Delhi,Context of Hindu nationalism,NA,"Ongoing democratic backsliding is obvious to the respondent, but they do mention that things cannot probably get as bad as Germany under Hitler (an exaggeration often invoked in Indian politics) because of the large population size of the Muslims. The ruling party will do whatever it can short of genocide."
R19,"In theory, democracy provides freedom to every individual, but in practice, communalism has become a game that is being played. What happens in democracy is that, during elections, parties present a manifesto, make promises to the people, and then try to fulfil those promises. However, today, the opposite is happening. Governments elected for five years are not focusing on development or the roadmap they presented. Instead, by the time elections arrive, they are playing communal games. This communalism creates divisions among people, and I believe it is not only a threat to democracy but also to the nation itself.",Democracy_Trends,Communalism,Government,INC,Uttarakhand,NA,NA,"Communalism cited as a threat to Indian democracy and the nation itself, but the reason cited primarily concerns communalism diverting attention from development and destroying ""harmony."""
R19,"The biggest challenge is communalism. The responsibility of any government is to maintain harmony in the country, but the opposite is happening today. The very people in power are working to disrupt harmony. If we claim to be a democracy and such actions continue, it weakens the foundation of democracy and acts contrary to the principles of the Constitution.",Democracy_Trends,Communalism,Government,INC,Uttarakhand,NA,NA,The BJP is identified as the primary driver of communalism.
R19,"There has been deterioration [of democracy]. If there hadn’t been, then during elections, why would this communal game be played? When one goes into elections, the focus should be on the promises made to the people and on the developmental work done over the past five years. But that’s not the case. Today, the discussion revolves around Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, and Christians instead. The result of this is that democracy is weakening.",Democracy_Trends,Communalism,Government,INC,Uttarakhand,NA,NA,"Interesting to think about the direction of causality here. The respondent cites communal games as evidence of ongoing democratic backsliding, but expresses it such that it seems like a natural consequence of backsliding."
R23,"At present, there are many issues. Problems exist on both sides—on the leadership side, among the representatives being elected, and on the public side as well. Although the level of education in the country has increased, the sensitivity among people has decreased. Politics is being played in the name of religion, and the consequence of this is that the ruling party is doing whatever it wants while the public's attention is not on important matters. Division is being created among people in the name of religion. The way Afghanistan and Pakistan have faced consequences, India seems to be moving in a similar direction.",Democracy_Trends,Communalism,Party,INC,Uttarakhand,Context of neighbouring countries such as Pakistan and Afghanistan invoked to signal the direction India is currently moving in.,NA,"Communalism by the BJP is both creating division and also diverting the attention of the public from more ""important"" matters. What these might be are not clearly specified."
R23,"The narratives being set include the Hindu-Muslim divide. Sometimes it’s about shrines, sometimes about madrasas, and the choice of words being used politically, like jihad. For example, when discussing land encroachment, it is labeled as land jihad instead of simply stating that the land has been occupied. Even in cases of illegal encroachments on municipal land, the government does nothing to stop it. But by highlighting only the 6 or 4 shrines, they are creating a specific atmosphere.",Democracy_Trends,Communalism,Party,INC,Uttarakhand,Religious politicisation of seemingly non-religious issues.,NA,Examples of where religious divide is being created.

If voting behavior isn’t right, if you are voting based on gestures like folded hands or religious considerations—Hindu or Muslim—you’re not bringing in good representatives or educated people. How can the system improve then? Laws will only be as good as the lawmakers. This is the most important aspect, and there must be awareness about what truly matters to us. The public needs to decide its priorities. Only educated individuals can be expected to understand this, and they need to be sensitive to the issues. If we blindly follow what the media shows or what a leader says in their speeches, things will never improve.

R6,"Another important issue just came to my mind. Until recently, the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner was done by a three-member committee, which included the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. This ensured a balance in decision-making. The Chief Election Commissioner holds a highly significant position because they are responsible for conducting elections fairly and ensuring that they are not biased. The presence of the Leader of the Opposition ensured that the selection of the Election Commissioner was fair. The Prime Minister, being the head of the government, would also play a key role in the decision, and the third member, the Chief Justice of India—one of the pillars of democracy—ensured judicial oversight. But suddenly, since the ruling party has a majority in Parliament, they changed this system. Now, they have removed the Chief Justice from the selection process. The committee will still include the Leader of the Opposition, but now, in addition to the Prime Minister, there will be a cabinet minister appointed by the Prime Minister himself. This means that the balance has shifted—two members will be from the ruling party, while only one will be from the opposition. The cabinet minister, being selected by the Prime Minister, will naturally vote in favor of whoever the ruling party wants as the Chief Election Commissioner. Now, if the Election Commissioner is selected entirely at the discretion of the ruling party, then how can elections be conducted fairly? What will happen to democracy? The upcoming elections will now be overseen by an Election Commissioner who has been chosen by the Prime Minister and his appointed minister. The Leader of the Opposition will have only one vote, making their role nearly irrelevant. So how can anyone say that our democracy is safe?",Democracy_Trends,Institutional_Threats,Government,JMM,Jharkhand,Very important context of a recent change in the process of the apointment of the Chief Election Commissioner.,NA,Important example of recent institutional decay in Indian democracy; BJP singled out as the reason for this change.
R6,"But the problem is that if laws are being made in Parliament, then it is through those laws that democracy can be safeguarded. If the appointment of the Election Commissioner is being done within Parliament itself, the issue arises that the majority in power will always shape the laws according to their own interests. The real concern is that, at the moment, democracy is being systematically dismantled in ways we have never seen before. Earlier, there was never such large-scale political engineering as we see now. The ruling party at the center has overturned democratically elected governments across various states. They have manipulated elected representatives, turned them in their favor, and brought down state governments. Now, I don’t have concrete evidence of whether they were bribed, coerced, or blackmailed, but what happened in Maharashtra is clear. The Prime Minister himself made serious allegations against Ajit Pawar, and yet, after a while, Ajit Pawar was brought into their own party and given a ministerial position. If someone was corrupt, as they themselves claimed, then how is it that as soon as he joins their party, he is fit to become a minister? The same happened with Himanta Biswa Sarma and Chhagan Bhujbal. BJP leaders previously accused them of corruption, but as soon as they switched sides and joined the ruling party, those accusations disappeared. In fact, it was even said that Chhagan Bhujbal's corruption case files had ""gone missing."" Selective action is being taken—investigative agencies, which are supposed to be neutral and unbiased, are disproportionately targeting opposition leaders. If you look at the statistics, the vast majority of Enforcement Directorate (ED) cases are being filed against opposition leaders.

Judicial processes have become so expensive that 95% of India’s population cannot even afford them. If your case reaches the Supreme Court, a regular lawyer charges ?2 lakh to ?3 lakh per hearing.

However, these practices have gradually diminished over time. Now, during election periods, raids are conducted everywhere.

Because they were seen as significant leaders, and their presence in Parliament was considered essential for healthy discussions. For instance, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was going to America for medical treatment, Rahul Gandhi, despite being from the opposition, was sent as India’s representative to the UNO. This shows how leaders used to strengthen democracy. They understood that while the ruling party has its place, the opposition also holds an important position and must be given due regard. Earlier, the primary focus in democracy was to maintain a balance where both the ruling and opposition parties played essential roles. Democracy thrives on a strong opposition. Without a strong opposition, there is always a risk of a dictatorial system evolving.

R5,"Today, it [democracy] is all about money and power. Technically, if we want, we have the right to contest elections. But when you actually go to the ground to contest, you realize it requires a massive amount of money. Our Election Commission has set spending limits—if you're contesting for a local leader position (Mukhiya), there's a set limit on how much you can spend; if you're contesting for an MLA position, there's another fixed amount; and if you're running for MP, the spending cap is around ?80 lakh. But practically, on the ground, even for small elections—let alone major elections—people spend crores just for a Mukhiya (local leader) election. That is where our democracy gets corrupted because it essentially means that not everyone can participate in the political process beyond just voting. The political process continues beyond elections, but only a select few can truly participate in it. In the end, the definition of democracy has been reduced to just one thing—""We have the right to vote."" But the moment we cast our vote, our rights effectively end. That is what I feel about democracy in today’s time.",Democracy_Trends,Financial_Dominance,Media,Neutral,India,NA,NA,"The respondent is highlighting an interesting divide between the right to vote and the right to contest, the latter of which is argued to be in a complete decline due to the concentration of financial resources required to run in any elections, even at the lowest levels of governance.

R6,"See, right now, many things are being handed over to the private sector. Airports, major companies—everything is moving toward privatization. Gradually, this is turning into a bureaucratic state where bureaucracy is becoming increasingly dominant. This is the main problem at the moment.

Some large industrialists are taking the nation’s money and fleeing abroad, yet no strict action is being taken against them. No real attention is being paid to this. At the same time, some industrialists are receiving extremely favorable conditions, allowing them to accumulate even more wealth. Electoral bonds are another example—around 6,500 crore rupees, if I’m not mistaken, have gone into political party accounts through these bonds.

R6,"If the ruling party is receiving the largest share of this money—approximately 6,500 crores, as per reports—then why is this not being disclosed to the public? The Supreme Court even questioned this, asking why the State Bank of India (SBI) has the records of these transactions, but the Election Commission does not. Why is this information not declared to the people? Why are voters not allowed to know who is donating such large sums and for what purpose? If the donors made their names public, at least the citizens would be informed. But neither their identities are disclosed, nor is the reason behind their contributions made clear. So, if people do not even know why and how this money is being used, how can anyone claim that democracy is not under threat? The government insists that every citizen must follow transparency norms, that ordinary people cannot engage in money laundering or hold black money, so why are political parties allowed to do so?

R11,"Like look, in the 90s and just before 2014, because of the federal nature of politics, there were a lot of industrialists or capital or prominent industrial houses/groups/corporate houses, which were emerging from regional centers. Like in aviation, GMR was very powerful. Or in Telecom, number of players were not at the national level, there were many regional players. In Telecom, in airlines, in media, in number of businesses, cement or infrastructure or electricity. But now, in the last decade, things are moving in the direction of this centralizing force through mergers and acquisitions, with only few big, corporate houses. Who are, in their nature, all-India. They are not just limited to either Tamil Nadu or Andhra Pradesh or based in those states and from there expanding. During the 1980s till the last decade, they were coming from these states and expanding nationally. They were, like, the regional political party sharing power with the government in Delhi. Similarly, a number of corporates were coming from these states and trying to expand themselves. Now, this trend has reversed. Like the political party at the centre accepting to share power with the regional party. Take the case of Adani, where Mumbai Airport was run by one South Indian company before, which were forced to sell it to the Adanis. Similarly in cement business, in electricity, in power, in coal, or in telecommunications, just see what is happening. Telecommunications is now completely monopolized by Ambani. Of course, Airtel is there, and Vodafone is there. But Vodafone is almost dying. Airtel is trying to compete, but initially the leader of the market is now number two in comparison to Jio. So, they [all-India industrialist] are supporting this unitary nature of Indian state, where the power should be centralized. And it is with some close big corporate groups, who are now controlling everything...This is what we are actually witnessing in a number of other countries as well. It’s not unique to India. You can see in recent, last fifteen-twenty, this is what is happening in Philippines, in Turkey, in Hungary, in a number of other European countries. Where the State is captured by a strongman leader, and under strongman leader, capitalism is flourishing. Some of the toughest...of course, Modi withdrew these three farm laws, but the truth is that he tried to bring this. Labour reforms, agricultural reforms, these are the toughest reforms.

We’ve seen instances where individuals with multiple criminal cases against them have managed to win elections even from jail. Muscle power and money power are dominating. Some offenders with serious criminal backgrounds, whose crimes remain unproven due to the system, are now reaching decision-making positions through politics. This weakens democracy. Take, for example, the elections for Gram Pradhan (village head). In larger village assemblies, candidates are spending lakhs, even crores of rupees. Similarly, in assembly elections, crores of rupees are being spent—spending 5–6 crores is now seen as routine. When a representative wins after spending such huge sums of money, they naturally think, ""I spent 10 crores to become an MLA, so I need to earn even more to recoup that investment and prepare for the next election."" This creates a problematic situation. Today, if an honest, intelligent, and thoughtful person wants to contest elections, people see them as naïve. Such individuals struggle to succeed. This is a dark side of democracy where capable and honest people are not advancing, while manipulative individuals and those who have amassed wealth through illegitimate means are moving ahead. These individuals, once elected as MLAs or MPs, eventually become ministers and take on decision-making roles. This growing trend of prioritizing money and muscle power over integrity is a major concern for our democracy.",Democracy_Trends,Financial_Dominance,Party,BJP,Uttarakhand,Context of the respondent being a member of the BJP but acknowledging the influence of money in politics undermining elections in democracy.,NA,"It is extremely interesting that the respondent, despite being a BJP member, is very forthcoming and talks in detail about how those with excess financial powers are gaining dominance and distorting Indian democracy. Also mentions that honest people attempting to contest elections are seen as naive. This is the ""dark side"" of Indian democracy according to the respondent, wherein capable and honest people are not advancing, but manipulative individuals and those who have amassed wealth through illegitimate means are moving ahead to decision-making roles. Obviously the respondent does not mention the BJP and frames it as a general ongoing scenario, but it is very interesting to note their honesty regardless."
R13,"Such financial dominance negatively affects democracy. If an educated individual, such as a respected school principal or a visionary thinker who has contributed significantly to society, wishes to contest elections, they simply can’t afford to. This leaves the field open for manipulative individuals who have amassed wealth through dubious means. Many contractors have now become legislators, and their primary focus upon winning is securing government contracts for themselves. Instead of addressing public concerns, they prioritize personal gain. This is one of the dark aspects of our democracy. Another is the role of media. While we consider media to be the fourth pillar of democracy, today, much of it is compromised. A significant portion—70–75% of newspapers and news channels—operates on a paid model, where content is dictated by financial transactions. People are unaware of this manipulation and assume what they read or see in the news is true. Instead, large deals ensure favorable coverage for some and silence on critical issues.",Democracy_Trends,Financial_Dominance,Party,BJP,Uttarakhand,Context of the respondent being a member of the BJP but acknowledging the influence of money in politics undermining media in democracy.,NA,"Again, it is extremely interesting that the respondent is very forthcoming in highlighting that the influence of money in current politics is also working to undermine democracy through its effects on ""buying out"" the media."

For instance, in Bihar, Lalu Prasad Yadav served as Chief Minister for 15 years across three terms, maintaining a stronghold over governance. At the time, it seemed impossible to unseat him. However, the people recognized the need for change and voted him out, ushering in a new government. Similarly, in Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam Singh Yadav once dominated the state's politics. During his tenure, democratic values were trampled upon, and the Ram Mandir movement became a significant issue. We believe that the suppression and persecution by Mulayam Singh Yadav played a crucial role in making the Ram Mandir movement successful. People perceived him as a harsh ruler and ousted him from power. At the national level, something similar happened with Indira Gandhi. During her tenure as Prime Minister, there was a saying: ""India is Indira, and Indira is India."" This phrase symbolized her dominance, where she became synonymous with the nation itself. She was considered an unmatched and formidable leader. However, when she imposed Emergency, suspending the fundamental rights of citizens and jailing opposition leaders, the people rejected her. In 1980, they voted her out of power, electing the Janata Party to form the government.

It’s not an easy thing. Unless you have precise booth data—such as how many votes are cast in a specific booth, the percentage expected for Congress, the percentage for BJP—you cannot manipulate it.

R13,"Look, to safeguard democracy, the most important thing is to maintain stability within the country. For example, during the period between 1989 and 2014, we saw governments at the center working through collaborations. During Atal Ji’s time, a coalition of 28 parties ran the government. Similarly, there were allegations against Prime Minister Narasimha Rao that he had to resort to buying support to sustain his government. During B.P. Singh's tenure, collaboration politics prevailed, and even during Manmohan Singh Ji’s time, his government relied on the support of others. What happens in such coalition scenarios is that if a coalition partner is involved in unethical practices or makes demands harmful to the nation, the government often has to accommodate those demands just to remain in power. This instability and the compulsions of running a coalition government can be detrimental to the nation. To address this, stability is essential. At any level, having a clear majority is crucial. For example, since 2014, Modi Ji has been receiving a full majority, and because of this, he has been able to work decisively. Whether it’s decisions on foreign policy, internal matters, roads, railways, or aviation, he can make these decisions without being constrained by coalition partners or fearing their dissatisfaction. This stability, with one party having a clear majority, is critical for the nation’s development, for executing plans effectively, and for strengthening and empowering the country.

Earlier, there were no schools or higher education institutions in many areas, and education often stopped after the intermediate level. Today, the number of universities has increased significantly, and people have ample opportunities for higher education and employment. The situation today is vastly different from what it was in the 1970s. India has advanced significantly. Earlier, people who went abroad preferred to settle there and rarely returned. But today, those who work abroad feel pride in calling themselves Indian. They are eager to send money back to India and support their families. This was not the case before, as people preferred to leave and stay abroad. I feel that in the coming years, people’s awareness and sense of responsibility will grow even more. The role of the public in safeguarding democracy is crucial. India’s younger generation, which constitutes 65% of the population, is ready to bring about change and provide direction to the country. On the other hand, if you look at China, its population is aging, with a majority belonging to the older generation.

They have given leadership a chance, and when they have found it unsatisfactory, they have replaced it again. This has happened multiple times. Not long ago, a movement arose, which I wouldn't necessarily call the Aam Aadmi Party, but rather the Anna Movement. Consider how, at one point, it seemed as if every individual had become a part of corruption, that even the common person had accepted corruption as a norm. However, when the anti-corruption movement began, every town square in the country was filled with people protesting against corruption. And this was not just performative—it was a fire within them.

This reflects cultural change. Similarly, democracy will also evolve over time. However, evolving democracy doesn’t mean the essence of democracy is lost. It’s a natural process.

For example, the central government has the authority to terminate any state government based on the report of the governor, who is appointed by the center itself. The governor is a constitutional authority, but he is appointed by the center. The center appoints whomever it prefers, usually selecting individuals who align with the ruling regime at the center. For example, at present, if the central government wants to remove a state government, they only need to ask the governor to submit a report stating that law and order has collapsed in the state or that constitutional provisions are under threat. Based on that report, the current central government can dismiss the state government and impose President’s Rule. So, power has always remained concentrated at the center. According to the Constitution, there are many subjects divided between the center and the states.

But when the government changed and a tribal-led government came to power in the state, the power distribution company (DVC) suddenly demanded that all outstanding payments be cleared; otherwise, electricity would be cut off. At the same time, the central government still owed ?1.36 lakh crore in coal royalties to the state, but it refused to pay. The amount the state owed for electricity was a much smaller sum, but it was still denied. So, they cut the electricity supply. This is where the problem arises. If the central and state governments are from different parties, the central government can deliberately create obstacles. Electricity supply can be cut, and the public, unaware of the larger financial issues, will blame the local state government for not providing power. This dissatisfaction among the public benefits the central government politically because, in the next election, people may vote against the state government, thinking that it failed them. The central government sometimes deliberately restricts benefits and resources to opposition-led states, while giving more resources to states governed by its own party, hoping that this will translate into greater public support for them.",Linkages,Party_Linkages,Government,JMM,Jharkhand,"Jharkhand, Double Engine Government, BJP versus Opposition",NA,"Party-Fiscal Overlap, Key for quotations, Acknowledges the superior position of the Indian centre, also echoes a very similar sentiment to R1"
R6,"See, this is like the saying about the Delhi sweet—whether you eat it or not, you will regret it either way. It is the same with this issue. If you have a double-engine government, then small regional parties, which I previously mentioned are crucial for preserving culture, language, and identity, may struggle. But these regional parties are essential because they help ensure that local identities and cultural heritage are safeguarded. They provide representation for local issues, help communities progress, and can even rise to positions in ministries at the national level. However, the downside is that when different parties govern the center and the state, the central government often discriminates against the state government. Regardless of which party is in power, there is always an attempt to withhold resources from opposition-led state governments because the ruling party at the center fears that if the opposition-led state government is given enough support, it will gain strength, perform well, and make it harder for the central ruling party to win elections in that state. So, both systems have their advantages and disadvantages. A double-engine government can ensure smoother governance and resource allocation, but it can also weaken regional parties and local representation. On the other hand, a government where states maintain autonomy is crucial for preserving diverse cultures and identities, but it often leads to friction with the central government, which can result in discrimination in the allocation of resources.",Linkages,Party_Linkages,Government,JMM,Jharkhand,"Jharkhand, Double Engine Government, BJP versus Opposition",NA,"Party-Fiscal Overlap, Key for quotations, Acknowledges the superior position of the Indian centre"

R8,"The BJP today is a highly flexible party that adapts to changing times because they understand that they cannot rule with a rigid ideology alone. They continuously modify their approach based on the specific needs of different regions. Let me give you an example. In Northern India, cow smuggling and beef consumption are major issues. If a person from the minority community is seen carrying beef, it could even cost them their life. This has happened in Noida, in Jharkhand—there have been multiple cases where vehicles have been stopped, people have been beaten, even killed over allegations of cow smuggling. The cow issue is highly sensitive here. But what about Goa? The BJP has a government there, and the people consume beef. Yet, in Goa, they remain completely silent on beef. They do not utter a single word against it. The Northeast is another example. There was a minister, still in the cabinet, who previously served as the Law Minister and was also in the Ministry of Home Affairs before that—Kiren Rijiju. He has openly said, not just once but multiple times, that he eats beef. He has publicly declared, ""I eat beef, who can stop me?"" Did the BJP expel him? No. And he was not a minor figure; he was influential. When he was in the Home Ministry, he held an important position, and later he became the Law Minister. He had significant influence in constitutional matters and Supreme Court cases, and he was a well-regarded leader within the BJP. But despite his open admission of eating beef, was he removed from the party? No, he was not. Take Tripura as another example. Previously, the government there was run by the Communist Party of India (CPI-M), which remained in power for four or five consecutive terms. But now, the BJP has taken over. The top BJP leaders who went there to campaign would sit and eat beef with the local people. I can even mention a name—one of their key figures, originally from Maharashtra, was given charge of Tripura. He used to sit among the tribal communities, eat with them. Many tribal Hindus are non-vegetarian. Even within the broader Hindu community, while people often say Hindus are vegetarians, the reality is that the majority are not. And in Tripura, their leaders would eat everything; there was no controversy over it. Another example is from Kerala, though I don’t recall the exact year. In Kerala, beef consumption is widespread, among Muslims, Christians, and Hindus as well. Hindus are still the majority there. There was a BJP candidate—either in a Lok Sabha or Assembly election—who put up banners saying that if he won, he would ensure the supply of high-quality beef. Was he expelled from the party for this? No. So, the BJP is an extremely flexible party. It adapts to different situations in different regions. Take the RSS, for example. They argue that every person living in India is a Hindu—not in the religious sense, but in terms of cultural identity. They say that Hinduism is not a religion in the way Islam or Christianity are, which are based on a single book like the Quran or the Bible. In their view, Hinduism is a culture, a ""way of life."" That’s why they define ""Sanatan Dharma"" as a way of life rather than a religion. They argue that anyone living on this side of the Sindhu River is a Hindu, regardless of their religious path. Even tribals who do not identify as Hindu are still classified as Hindu by them. This flexibility is strategic. They understand that unless they capture power, they cannot impose their ideology on the entire nation. To do that, they need power. Once they gain power, they control the state machinery.

Like in aviation, GMR was very powerful. Or in Telecom, number of players were not at the national level, there were many regional players. In Telecom, in airlines, in media, in number of businesses, cement or infrastructure or electricity. But now, in the last decade, things are moving in the direction of this centralizing force through mergers and acquisitions, with only few big, corporate houses. Who are, in their nature, all-India. They are not just limited to either Tamil Nadu or Andhra Pradesh or based in those states and from there expanding. During the 1980s till the last decade, they were coming from these states and expanding nationally. They were, like, the regional political party sharing power with the government in Delhi. Similarly, a number of corporates were coming from these states and trying to expand themselves. Now, this trend has reversed. Like the political party at the centre accepting to share power with the regional party. Take the case of Adani, where Mumbai Airport was run by one South Indian company before, which were forced to sell it to the Adanis. Similarly in cement business, in electricity, in power, in coal, or in telecommunications, just see what is happening. Telecommunications is now completely monopolized by Ambani.

Then they say that everything has been since neutralized, now it is 30-32%. Because what they did was make it cesses and surcharges. Before, income tax and other taxes were divisible between centre and state. Cess and surcharges now are entirely for central government. Through this they increased their income, their share.

There is a public who does not want to vote for the BJP, but there are no leaders who are leading them. There are compartments, but no engine.

From our perspective, there are good models of democracy surely all over India at the state level.",Subnational_Democracy_Trends,Subnational_Stability,Bureaucrat,Neutral,Delhi,"Tamil Nadu, Kerala",NA,"Regional Issues, Development"
R12,"Yeah, today this question also came up that why are some states not really protesting as much as the Southern states are? For one, the BJP states will not protest at all. They are their stooges; they are their creation. So only opposition-ruled states can protest. Odisha is opposition-ruled but they also have an alliance. They do not protest. Mamta Banerjee does it. DMK does it. Kerala is doing it. These people are doing something, others are not doing anything.",Subnational_Democracy_Trends,Subnational_Stability,Bureaucrat,Neutral,Delhi,"Kerala, West Bengal, Odisha, Southern States, BJP versus Opposition",NA,"Party Rule, Coalition Politics"
R12,"Democracy of India is dependent on the Indian Government. But states can protest. If farmers protest, like those three laws they [the Centre] had to take back after all, right? But if Muslims protest, then the BJP, by polarizing India further, will benefit even more. It depends on who is protesting from which state. Just like Punjab conducted the farmer protest for a whole year.",Subnational_Democracy_Trends,Subnational_Stability,Bureaucrat,Neutral,Delhi,"Punjab, BJP versus Opposition",NA,"Mobilization, Acknowledges the superior position of the Indian centre, Less Central Conflict"
R19,"Look, even at the state level, efforts are made to ensure that we implement our programs and policies appropriately. Despite the central government being in power, states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, and Himachal Pradesh have formed governments of different parties, such as Congress. If the situation in a state does not align with the people’s expectations, they are the ones who bring about change. In states like Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, the people have formed their governments.",Subnational_Democracy_Trends,Subnational_Stability,Government,INC,Uttarakhand,"Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh",NA,"Party Rule, Regional Issues, Healthy Electoral Competition"
R19,"As I mentioned earlier, the BJP has an agenda, and that agenda is communalism. Where this agenda works, they manage to form governments. In the South, it isn’t working, and they are unable to establish their governments. In the states where BJP is currently in power, it’s because people have accepted them for now, but changes have occurred in other states… Look, BJP has a government in Assam, but in many other Northeastern states, it’s mostly coalition governments. Coalition governments are formed from time to time.",Subnational_Democracy_Trends,Subnational_Stability,Government,INC,Uttarakhand,"Southern States, Assam, Northeastern States, BJP versus Opposition",NA,"Party Rule, Regional Issues, Coalition Politics, Healthy Electoral Competition"
R19,"If I talk about past instances, in Rajasthan, they tried but failed, and our government lasted five years. After that, BJP formed the government post-elections, which is a different matter.

R19,"Look, the BJP was in power at the center. Despite that, when elections were held, Congress achieved full majority governments in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.

R19,"Look, if the government is not formed at the center, it doesn’t mean that governments cannot be formed in states. As I mentioned earlier, even though the BJP formed the government at the center, during subsequent elections, they couldn’t form governments in some states. For example, in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, or Himachal Pradesh, there were changes in government.

R22,"It will be difficult because everything has already been dismantled. When the center itself is unstable, how can states preserve democracy? The states can only do what they are permitted to do, and even at the state level, those aligned with the center have taken control. In states where this isn’t the case, those governments need to think about protecting democracy, design appropriate plans, and speak out strongly against the central government’s wrong policies. If they speak out assertively, democracy can certainly be preserved. Otherwise, there will be no one left to protect democracy in this country.",Subnational_Democracy_Trends,Subnational_Stability,Party,INC,Uttarakhand,BJP versus Opposition,NA,"Party Rule, Mobilization, Regional Issues"
